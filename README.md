# Two-Player Tank Battle Game

## Overview

Implemented a two-player (1 vs 1) game mode where players face off on hilly terrain, taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn, are allowed to position themselves for a better shot, and must shoot at one another until one of their tanks is destroyed. 

Extended the scope of the game by creating vector-based animations and enforcing closely replicated game physics.
