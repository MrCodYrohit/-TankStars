# -TankStars
A clone of Tank Stars game.

● Implemented the two-player (1 vs 1) game mode where players face off on hilly terrain,
 taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn and are
 allowed to position themselves for a better shot and must shoot at one another until one of
 their tanks is destroyed.


 ● Extended the scope of the game by creating vector based animations and enforcing closely
 replicated Game Physics.
